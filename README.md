## about

soba is tool for backing up private and public git repositories hosted on the
most popular hosting providers. It generates a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Bundling) that stores a backup of each repository as a
single file.  

An unchanged git repository will create an identical bundle file so bundles will only be stored if a change has been
made and will not produce duplicates.

## latest updates

**1.1.3 released 2022-10-12**  
Fixes issues that resulted in only a subset of GitLab Projects being backed up.  
All Projects across GitLab will now be returned, based on the user's minimum access level. The default level is 'Reporter' and can be overriden by setting environment variable:
`GITLAB_PROJECT_MIN_ACCESS_LEVEL` to the numeric value associated with the level shown [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#valid-access-levels).  
Thanks to [@drummingdemon](https://github.com/drummingdemon) for all their help in testing this release.

**1.1.2 released 2022-06-03**  
[Add feature](https://github.com/jonhadfield/soba/issues/9) to enable backup of project repos in GitLab groups

**1.1.1 released 2022-03-13**  
[Add feature](https://github.com/jonhadfield/soba/issues/7) to enable backup of GitHub organisations' repositories

**1.1.0 released 2021-10-27**  
Resolve exit on backup failure issue

### Supported OSes

Tested on Windows 10, MacOS, and Linux (amd64).  
Not tested, but should also work on builds for: Linux (386, arm386 and arm64), FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

### supported providers

- BitBucket
- GitHub (including organisations)
- GitLab

## configuration

soba can be run from the command line or as docker container. In both cases the only configuration required is an
environment variable with the directory in which to create backups, and additional to define credentials for each the
providers.

On Windows 10:

- search for 'environment variables' and choose 'Edit environment variables for your account'
- choose 'New...' under the top pane and enter the name/key and value for each of the settings

On Linux and MacOS you would set these using:

```bash
export GIT_BACKUP_DIR="/repo-backups/"
```

To set provider tokens see [below](#setting-provider-tokens).

### run using command line

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/jonhadfield/soba/releases) and then install:

```bash
install <soba binary> /usr/local/bin/soba
```

After setting GIT_BACKUP_DIR, set your provider token(s) as detailed [here](#setting-provider-tokens).

and then run:

```bash
soba
```

### run using docker

Using docker enables you to run soba without anything else installed.

Docker requires you pass environment variables to the container using the '-e' option and that you mount your preferred
backup directory. For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -t \
             -v <your backup dir>:/backup \
             -e GIT_BACKUP_DIR='/backup' \
             -e GITHUB_TOKEN='MYGITHUBTOKEN' \
             -e GITLAB_TOKEN='MYGITLABTOKEN' \
             ghcr.io/jonhadfield/soba
```

To hide credentials, you can instead use exported environment variables and specify using this syntax:

```bash
docker run --rm -t \
             -v <your backup dir>:/backup \
             -e GIT_BACKUP_DIR='/backup' \
             -e GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
             -e GITLAB_TOKEN=$GITLAB_TOKEN \
             ghcr.io/jonhadfield/soba
```

## scheduling backups

Backups can be scheduled to run by setting an additional environment variable: GIT_BACKUP_INTERVAL. The value is the
number of hours between backups. For example, this will run the backup daily:

```bash
export GIT_BACKUP_INTERVAL=24
```

if using docker then add:

```bash
-e GIT_BACKUP_INTERVAL=24
```

_Note: the interval is added to the start of the last backup and not the time it finished. Therefore, ensure the
interval is greater than the duration of a backup._

## rotating backups

A new bundle is created every time a change is detected in the repository. To keep only the _x_ most recent, use the
following provider specific environment variables:
  - GITHUB_BACKUPS=_x_
- GITLAB_BACKUPS=_x_
- BITBUCKET_BACKUPS=_x_

## setting provider tokens
On Linux and MacOS you can set environment variables manually before each time you run soba:

```bash
export NAME='VALUE'
```

or by defining in a startup file for your shell so they are automatically set and available when you need them. For
example, if using the bash shell and running soba as your user, add the relevant export statements to the following
file:

```bash
/home/<your-user-id>/.bashrc
```

and run:

```bash
source /home/<your-user-id>/.bashrc
```

### additional options

#### GitHub - Returning Organisations' repositories

Repositories in GitHub organisations are not backed up by default. To back these up, specify a comma separated
list of organisations in the environment variable: GITHUB_ORGS.

#### GitLab - filtering Projects by access level

Release 1.1.3 modified the way in which a user's GitLab Projects are returned. By default, every Project a user has at
least `Reporter` access to will be returned. New environment variable GITLAB_PROJECT_MIN_ACCESS_LEVEL can be set to
override this, by specifying the number matching the desired access level shown [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#valid-access-levels) and here:  

| Access Level | Value |
|:-------------|:------|
| Guest        | 10    |
| Reporter     | 20    |
| Developer    | 30    |                                                                                          |
| Maintainer   | 40    |
| Owner        | 50    |

## restore

A Git bundle is an archive of a Git repository. The simplest way to restore is to clone it like a remote repository.

```bash
git clone soba.20180708153107.bundle soba.
```
